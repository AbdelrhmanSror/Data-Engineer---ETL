Sure, here's an updated README file that reflects the fact that data loading is done by writing data to a CSV file:

# ETL Engineer Peer Review Assignment

This Jupyter Notebook contains an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for processing data related to a fictional online store. The notebook is part of a peer review assignment for an ETL Engineer certification.

## Getting Started

To use this notebook, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your computer. You can download Jupyter Notebook from the official website: https://jupyter.org/install

Once you have Jupyter Notebook installed, you can open the notebook by running the following command in your terminal:

```
jupyter notebook ETL_Engineer_Peer_Review_Assignment.ipynb
```

This will open the notebook in your default web browser.

## Usage

The notebook contains code cells that can be executed to perform various ETL tasks. The tasks include:

- Data extraction: Reading data from CSV files using Pandas
- Data cleaning: Removing duplicates, filling missing values, and converting data types
- Data transformation: Combining data from multiple sources and creating new columns
- Data loading: Writing data to a CSV file using Pandas

To run the ETL pipeline, simply execute the code cells in order. The notebook includes comments and markdown cells to explain each step of the process.

## Dependencies

This notebook requires the following Python packages:

- Pandas

You can install this package using pip:

```
pip install pandas
```
